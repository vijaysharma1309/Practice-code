Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.

Input:
The first line contains T, denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case begins with a single positive integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A.

Output:
For each testcase, print "Yes" or  "No" whether it is Pythagorean Triplet or not (without quotes).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

Example:
Input:
1
5
3 2 4 6 5

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
Testcase 1: a=3, b=4, and c=5 forms a pythagorean triplet, so we print "Yes"
